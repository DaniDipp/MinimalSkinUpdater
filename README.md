# Minimal Skin Updater
Proof-of-concept paper plugin that uses [Player#setPlayerProfile()](https://jd.papermc.io/paper/1.20/org/bukkit/entity/Player.html#setPlayerProfile(com.destroystokyo.paper.profile.PlayerProfile)) to update a player's skin on the fly.

# Usage
There are a few hard-coded skin urls. Use `/skin` to get a random one applied.

# Building
```gradle build```
